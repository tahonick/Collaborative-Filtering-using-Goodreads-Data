# Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendations

With so many book options, it can be challenging for people to find books that they enjoy. By approaching the problem from a linear algebra standpoint, you can relatively easily apply collaborative filtering to find books similar to each other based on reading and rating history of similar users.

Our project applied this method to goodreads data and found it incredibly effective.

Note: To run the code, you will need to replace the file references.
